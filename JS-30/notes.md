#### Parts of OOP Object Literal

-   Constructor functions
-   Methods â€” Instance, Static, and Prototype Methods
-   Classes - ES6
-   Instances ( new , this)
-   Objects and Classes
-   Getters and Setters
-   Inheritance with extends and super

#### The four pillars of OOP are

-   Encapsulation - Keeping Secrets Safe
    -   Encapsulation means that the internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside.,
-   Inheritance - Get Super Powers passing down new heros
    -   Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
-   Abstraction - Keep it simple
    -   Abstraction involves creating simple models representing complex real-world objects.
-   Polymorphism - Different Heros but same actions
    -   Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

#### Fun fact: OOP Classes in JavaScript are not truly OOP. This is in fact syntactic sugar (i.e., magic. Do not look behind the curtain!) that looks and behaves like OOP but is simply prototypal inheritance under the hood.
